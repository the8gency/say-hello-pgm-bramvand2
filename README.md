# Hi! I'm Bram.  

I'm a 31 year old nerd, who used to be a plumber before he got  medical issues and turned his life upside down.
The upside down part ? Well I decided to re-educate myself and signed up for a graduate programming course at the Artevelde College in Mariakerke Ghent.
I've been giving this course my all as a student for 8 months now and I'm still in love with Programming and everything around it. The best part is the problemsolving.
My hobbies are reading, gaming, watching movies and walking with my dog Flor.

Well that's me in a nutshell. If you want to know more keep on scrolling!
